# Predictive Model based on the number of shares.
## PROBLEM
• The idea is to help the startup websites like blogging, tech and articles sites whoose revenue or profit is depend 
upon the many factors where are here carrying the articles success rate is depend upon the no of shares on the particular articles.

## SOLUTION
• We are do factor the data analysis to determine which factor/features high imfact the dependent varibles. \n
• For this PCA/Standscalar is we are used for the dimension reduction. \n
• Then apply the different kind of regression algorithm.

## KEY ISSUES 
• Data contains large number of features 
• Prediction is of continuous value (shares) 

## BENEFITS
Mashable’s entire business is dependent on popularity of articles. With accurate prediction of shares, company can choose which articles to publish hence driving higher user engagement and profits. Rough estimate is 1% increase in engagement time (minutes) increases profit by up to 5%.

## DEPLOYMENT
• We are going to used the flask for the deployment of our project.

## RESULT OF THE PROJECT (What I learn from the event) 
• We have learnt first before going for the ML model first analyize the datasets more for clearly.
• Find out the same correlation features in the datasets
• Explatory Data Analysis is the major task before building the ML model.
• We can further improves or scale the model so it can be deployed in the real time.
• Further we can cluster the same type of features into the different-2 cluster and performing K-mean clustering /Xgboost/adaboost which are the stronger learner.
• Further first time introdued with GOOGLE COLAB.
